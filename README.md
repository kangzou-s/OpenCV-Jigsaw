# Jigsaw puzzle detection and alignment with OpenCV

## Abstract
This project is based on a jigsaw puzzle. First we divide a square picture into 16 pieces, each with a few bumps and depressions.Then the pieces are placed on a colored background after being disordered and rotated in orientation. This program is about extracting these pieces, aligning and categorising them.The key points of this project are color space transformation, contour extraction and redrawing, finding the convex hull, checking convexity, image rotation, expansion and cropping.

## Requirements:
### Required languages:
* python 3.8.5 or later
### Required packages:
* opencv2
* numpy
* matplotlib

## Installation and setup
To solve this problem, after installing the packages described above, you can simply run the two scripts in this repository to get the extracted and rotated pieces, which will show some images of the process, with the waitkey parameter set to 0, so just hit the space to continue.

The first script is "**[1_segment_pieces.py"](1_segment_pieces.py)**, note that on lines 9 and 10 of this script, you need to set the path to the input image. On line 60, you need to specify the path to the output and the name of the output image. The purpose of this script is to extract the pieces from the coloured background.

The second script is **['3_orient_pieces.py'](3_orient_pieces.py)**. Note that the path to the input image is specified on lines 16 and 17 of this script, and the path and name of the output image is specified on line 180. The purpose of this script is to rotate the extracted pieces horizontally and vertically.

## Architecture
Here is the flow chart.![flow chart](img_presentation/jigsaw_Diagram.png)

There are five key steps in the process, and a brief explanation of how each step is implemented follows.

* color space transformation\
These pieces are placed on a green background. And **[HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV)** is a more intuitive color model than RGB. So we start by converting the image to the HSV colour space. After the background filtering we convert back to RGB.

```python       
pattern = cv.cvtColor(pattern,cv.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
lower_green = np.array([45,50,50])
upper_green = np.array([81,255,255])
mask1 = cv.inRange(pattern,lower_green,upper_green)
res = cv.bitwise_and(pattern,pattern, mask= mask1)
pattern = cv.cvtColor(res,cv.COLOR_HSV2BGR) 
```

* Contour extraction and redrawing\
The key to the extraction of pieces and subsequent processing is to find the contour, and the subsequent cutting and rotating steps are based on the analysis of the contour's shape. This is why this step is so important.
```python
contours, _ = cv.findContours(pattern, cv.RETR_TREE, cv.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

res = np.ones(pattern.shape, dtype=np.uint8) * 255
cv.drawContours(res, contours, -1, (100,100,100), thickness=cv.FILLED)
```
The above are only some of the steps in contour extraction and redrawing, the process also requires contour filtering and other steps. This article is not a complete description, but only an example.
```python
for k in range(len(contours)-1,-1,-1):
    if len(contours[k])<10:
        contours.pop(k)
```

* Finding convex hull, Checking convexity\
To determine the shape of the edge, we need to find the convex hull, and check the convexity.

```python
# find hull
hull_primary = cv.convexHull(cnt_primary,returnPoints = False)
defects_primary = cv.convexityDefects(cnt_primary,hull_primary)
defects_primary=np.squeeze(defects_primary)
# filter defects and draw out
for i in range(defects_primary.shape[0]-1,-1,-1):
    s,e,f,d = defects_primary[i]
    start = tuple(cnt_primary[s][0])
    end = tuple(cnt_primary[e][0])
    far = tuple(cnt_primary[f][0]) 
    if d <= L_primary:
    defects_primary=np.delete(defects_primary,i,0)
    continue
    print(d)         #to show convexity in pattern2
    cv.line(pattern2,start,end,[0,255,0],2) 
    cv.circle(pattern2,far,5,[0,0,255],-1)
cv.circle(pattern2,tuple(cnt_primary[0][0]),5,[0,0,255],-1)
```

* Image expansion and cropping\
As the pieces we get are small pieces that fit tightly around the edges, there is a risk that the image will be lost during rotation. Therefore the image needs to be expanded before rotation and cropped after rotation.
```python
# expand pieces to prepare for further processing
pattern = cv.imread('./segmented/piece_'+str(k)+'.png')
base = cv.imread('./segmented/piece_'+str(k)+'.png')
rows = pattern.shape[0]
cols = pattern.shape[1]
pattern1=np.zeros([rows*3,cols*3,3],dtype=np.uint8)  
pattern1[150:150+rows,150:150+cols,:]=base

#Cropping pieces
contours, _ = cv.findContours(fin, cv.RETR_TREE, cv.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
x,y,w,h = cv.boundingRect(contours[0])
cv.imwrite('./segmented/piece_'+'new_'+'6'+'.png',fin1[y:y+h, x:x+w])
```

* Image rotation\
After the contour has been cut and filled we can find a standard square. This square is analyzed to find its center of rotation and angle of rotation. We can then rotate it back to horizontal and vertical.

```python
rect = cv.minAreaRect(cnt_cut_fill)
M = cv.getRotationMatrix2D(rect[0],rect[2],1)
pattern3 = cv.warpAffine(pattern3,M,(cols*3,rows*3))
```
